 MYRTOS â€“ A Real-Time Operating System for ARM Cortex-M
MYRTOS is a fully custom real-time operating system (RTOS) developed in C for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers, without relying on any external libraries or middleware layers. The project focuses on building a practical RTOS from scratch using low-level concepts to achieve deterministic real-time performance and full control over hardware resources.

ðŸ“Œ Key Technical Features

âœ… Preemptive task scheduling using the SysTick and PendSV exceptions
âœ… Full context switching, including saving/restoring CPU registers and managing MSP and PSP stacks
âœ… Task management: task creation and switching between states (Ready, Running, Blocked)
âœ… Clear stack separation between the kernel (MSP) and user tasks (PSP)
âœ… Mutex mechanism for protecting shared resources and avoiding race conditions
âœ… Custom NVIC configuration to manage interrupt priorities
âœ… Timing services using SysTick for delay and time tracking
âœ… Modular and extensible design to support Semaphores, Queues, and Event Flags in the future
